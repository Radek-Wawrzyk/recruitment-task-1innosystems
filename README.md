# Recruitment-task
Recruitment task for the [1innosystems]

### About
UI is based on Photoshop file which I got. Front end is based on Vue.js ( SPA ), while Back end is based on Node.js with Express.js and NoSQL database MongoDB. I created REST API for communication between Front end and Back end. Aplication requires MongoDB local server. In the same moment you can run 2 applications, because CORS is setted and ports are different (8080 and 4000)

### Features
- Responsive website
- Reactive validation for form
- HTTPs Request for the server by REST API endpoint
- Responsive slider based on dynamic data
- Alert component which responds for the AJAX request
